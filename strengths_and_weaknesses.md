#Strengths

Github allows a standardized workflow in big coding projects with the possibility to return to former checkpoints

Multiple collaborators can work on the same project simultaneously

#Weaknesses

can overclomplicate workflow for one person 

a long project history takes up file space (also deleted files and old versions)
